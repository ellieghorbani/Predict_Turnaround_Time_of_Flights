## General info
The air transport demand keeps growing, schedules of flights in the global air transport system become more complex. The number of flights has increased since the early 2000s up to 2019 globally. This increase reached from 23.8 million in 2005 to 38.9 million in 2019 while in 2020 with increasing the Coronavirus pandemic,   the number of flight dropped to 16.4 million [“Global air traffic - number of flights 2004-2021”, Published by E. Mazareanu, Dec 2, 2020, https://www.statista.com/statistics/564769/airline-industry-number-of-flights/#statisticContainer]. 
Based on the above data, one of the operational goals of the air transport industry is to optimize the time of Gate‐to‐gate for flights, called Turnaround time (TAT). TAT is one of the most important parts to schedule flights in the airports. TAT is defined as the time required for an aircraft on the ground to be prepared for the departure from its arrival time at the gate.  [M. Abd Allah Makhloof, M. Elsayed Waheed, Usama A. El-Raouf Badawi. (2014) Real-time aircraft turnaround operations manager. Production Planning & Control 25:1, pages 2-25. ]. TAT is generally time consuming and not pleasant for passengers and costly for airlines. Airlines lose money due to inefficiency in plane boarding as they like to have their planes in the air in the minimum possible time. TAT is still a bottleneck in bringing the passengers to their seats and getting the plane to take-off in an efficient time.  
A survey by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics published information of the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in the U.S. Department of Transportation's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations [https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays].
The aim of this work is to predict the scheduling turnaround time of an aircraft in order to decrease conflicts of flights, maximize the passenger conveniences and optimize cost of air carriers. The details of the data are given in next Section with machine learning results and case studies of the proposed aircraft turnaround model.
